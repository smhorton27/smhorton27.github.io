    <p>This website drew my attention because of how the background elements move as you are scrolling down the page. In the sections
        with a blue background, there are smaller images that move faster than the speed of the user's scroll, making the website
        more visually interesting as you read it. 
    </p>
    <p>Another element I like about this website is that the designers added a timer at the bottom that is constantly going as long 
        as the user is still on the page. It's a small detail but it further elevates the narrative they are trying to convey.

    <p>I chose Stranger Things as my topic for Project 1 because I binge watched it over the summer and have been obsessed with it ever since. I love the storyline, the CGI, the character development, and I felt that it had the perfect number of seasons to fit into this project. Also, it could be a way to recap what has happened in the series so far before the release of the fifth season.</p>
    <p>I don't have a particular site that I am drawing inspiration from, but I do like this poster, and have been drawing a little bit of inspiration from it on this project:</p>
