    <p>This website drew my attention because of how the background elements move as you are scrolling down the page. In the sections
        with a blue background, there are smaller images that move faster than the speed of the user's scroll, making the website
        more visually interesting as you read it. 
    </p>
    <p>Another element I like about this website is that the designers added a timer at the bottom that is constantly going as long 
        as the user is still on the page. It's a small detail but it further elevates the narrative they are trying to convey.
